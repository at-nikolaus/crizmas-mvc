[Documentation](https://raulsebastianmihaila.github.io/crizmas-mvc-docs)

A framework based on React and the MVC pattern with the goal of simplifying front-end programming.

The main advantages and features are:  
- simplicity for common cases and flexibility for complicated cases  
- management of pending trees of objects  
- doesn't touch your model, allowing you to write it anyway you want
- router
  - option for case insensitivity
  - refresh from any fragment of the route
  - router manager for listing, adding and removing routes dynamically
- form
  - input management with or without a model
  - synchronous and asynchronous event based validation
